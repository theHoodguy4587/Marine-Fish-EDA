# Marine Fish Data Analysis üêü

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project based on a synthetic dataset of marine fish and their environmental interactions. The project aims to visualize and understand key factors impacting marine fish populations, such as overfishing risks and pollution levels.

## About the Dataset

### **Dataset Features**
- `Species_Name`: Name of the fish species.
- `Region`: Geographic region of the fish population.
- `Breeding_Season`: Breeding season (e.g., summer, winter, monsoon).
- `Fishing_Method`: Fishing techniques used (e.g., net, line, trawl).
- `Fish_Population`: Total population of fish.
- `Average_Size(cm)`: Average size of fish in centimeters.
- `Overfishing_Risk`: Whether the species is at risk of overfishing (Yes/No).
- `Water_Temperature(C)`: Temperature of water in the region (¬∞C).
- `Water_Pollution_Level`: Pollution levels (Low/Medium/High).

## Key Findings from the Analysis

1. **Fish Population by Species**:
   - Tuna and Cod have significantly higher populations compared to other species.

2. **Overfishing Risk and Pollution Levels**:
   - High-pollution regions show ~47% of fish species at risk of overfishing.
   - Surprisingly, ~53% of fish species in low-pollution areas are still at risk.

3. **Average Fish Size by Breeding Season**:
   - Fish sizes peak during the monsoon season (~57.45 cm average).
